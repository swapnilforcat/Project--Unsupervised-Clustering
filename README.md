# Project--Unsupervised-Clustering

This is an example of Unsupervised Clustering

Project Scope: Unsupervised Customers

Our client is an online retailer based in the United Kingdom (UK). They sell all occasion gifts and many of their customers are wholesellers. Most of their customers are bsed in the UK but they also have a small percentage of customers form other countries. They want to create groups of these international customers based on their previous purchase patterns. Their goal is to provide more tailored services and improve the way they market. to these international customers.
Current Solution: Currently the retailer simply groups their international customers by country. This is inefficient because,
There are large number of countries which defeats the purpose of creating groups.
Some countries have very few customers.
This approach treats the large and small customers the same regardlessof their purchase patterns.


Our role: 
The retailer has hired us to help them create 3 clusters of their international customers through a data driven approach. They have provided us with a data set with past purchased data at the transaction level. our task is to build a clustering model using that dataset. Our clustering model should factor in both
aggregate sales patterns, and
specific items purchased.


Goal: 
Build a clustering model to create groups of international customers based on their previous purchase patterns.


Specifics:
Machine Learning task: Unsupervised Clustering
Target variable: N/A
Input variables: Refer to data dictionary file - "Data Dictionary - Unsupervised Customers"
Deliverable: Clusters for customers
Success Criteria: N/A


This project will be carried out in 4 stages
1. Data Wrangling: Aggregating and Restructuring the dataset
2. Dimensionality Reduction: Breaking down the dimensions
3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Analyzing correlated features and explained variance
4. Cluster Analysis: Creating and analyzing clusters
